# BFS / Level order traversal
1. Take a Queue data structure. (can be linked-list/array etc. implemented as a Queue)
2. Add first vertex, to queue.
3. Pop a vertex from queue then visit it.
4. Then add all of its neighbours to queue (next nodes/vertexes).
5. Repeat step 3 & 4, stop if Queue is empty (and 3. cant pop now.).
